## Cricket Player Performance Prediction for 2025


---

## Introduction

This Java program predicts future cricket player performance for the year 2025 using linear regression based on historical data (2008 - 2024). The process involves:

- Reading performance data from a CSV file
- Cleaning and processing the data
- Building regression models for each player using Apache Commons Math
- Predicting 2025 performance and evaluating using R-squared values
- Visualizing results with JFreeChart in a GUI

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains detailed cricket player statistics with key columns such as:

- **Player_Name**: Name of the player
- **Matches_Batted**, **Not_Outs**, **Runs_Scored**: Batting performance
- **Highest_Score**, **Batting_Average**, **Balls_Faced**, **Batting_Strike_Rate**
- **Matches_Bowled**, **Balls_Bowled**, **Runs_Conceded**, **Wickets_Taken**: Bowling performance
- **Bowling_Average**, **Economy_Rate**, **Bowling_Strike_Rate**
- **Catches_Taken**, **Stumpings**: Fielding stats

This comprehensive dataset enables thorough analysis and prediction of player performance.

## Data Import

The CSV file containing player performance data is read and processed. The data is cleaned and structured into a format suitable for analysis.

## Regression Modeling

A linear regression model is built for each player using their historical performance data. This model is used to predict future performance, such as the number of runs each player will score in 2025.

## Prediction

The program predicts the runs each player is expected to score in 2025. The prediction accuracy is evaluated using R-squared values.

## Model Evaluation

R-squared values are computed for each playerâ€™s model to assess its accuracy. The results, including past and predicted performances, are visualized using JFreeChart.

## Visualization

### Bar Chart

A bar chart is created to display the previous and predicted performance of each player.

### Histogram

A histogram depicts the distribution of predicted runs for 2025, helping in understanding the spread and frequency of predicted runs across players.

## Statistical Analysis

The program conducts statistical analysis on the predicted runs for 2025, including:

- **Mean**: The average of the predicted runs
- **Median**: The middle value of the predicted runs
- **Standard Deviation**: The dispersion or variability of the data around the mean
- **Player with Highest and Lowest Predicted Runs**
